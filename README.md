Astrology is the ancient art of making predictions using the location of celestial bodies. AstraPredict seeks to modernize this art by implementing cutting-edge technology and knowledge of the true position of stars.

What makes astrapredict different?

- We take into account the precession of the equinox
- We use ML and AI to make predictions

Behind the scenes, the backend code uses machine learning models trained with the sidereal astrology position and the historical price of crypto-currencies. Once created, we are able to use any astrological position data to make a prediction for the price change at that time.
